# CinemaFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Introduction

This was small project I've build to improve my Angular skills. The idea was to build a ticketing system for a movie theather.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
